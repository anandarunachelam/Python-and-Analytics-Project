### Problem Statement: 
      Client is a salad making retailer which promotes healthy and conscious eating. The Chief growth officer is responsible for building a good strategy around marketing and operational excellence.
      The client wants to understand the Sales of the company in details and want you to address some business questions like:
      Which platforms/stores/categories generate maximum revenue?
      Did weekday sales performed better w.r.t weekend in terms of average daily sale(qty)?
      Furthermore, the client also want to perform a Market Basket Analysis to see the products that goes well together. But this kind of analysis requires the data to be formatted in a particular format.
###  Data Processing:
      1. Done data aggregation from various data sources into common data frame
      2. Cleaned the data by removing columns with missing values greater than 50%
      3. Handling missing values
      4. Checking the data types especially the datetime format
      5. Created new columns for analysis
      6. checking for duplicates
###  Exploratory Data Analysis:
      1. Have performed EDA and developed various charts using mathplot lib such as:
          - Maximum Sales for each month for each of the channels
          - Top 5 stores having maximum Sales each month
          - Percentage of Sales under each category of product
### Market Basket Analysis:
      1. Modified the data into different data frames
      2. Appending the data frames over a common column
      3. Removing the rows with missing data or having nulls
      4. Performed One Hot Encoding using the Pivot table in Python needed for performing Market Basket Analysis to bundle the products which could maximize Sales and Sales Margin.
